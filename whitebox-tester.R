# Testing script for watershed delineation using whitebox tools and NHDPlusHR
# flow accumulation raster. The goal is to give an input of a few points and have
# an output file of delineated watershed polygons in GPKG format? Format is still
# up for grabs I think. Not sure what would be the best default for this.

# This will require figuring out how to install whitebox tools as a package depenency
# for another package - I'm not sure how hard this actually is, but I don't know
# how to do it.
